    <p>Hey there YO! I hope you all are enjoying your winter breaks,
     whether you're out in the woods, climbing mountains, sprawled out on the beach,
     or like me, binging all 9 hours of 
     'Serial.' There's not much happening over break but I wanted to give you all a 
     heads up regarding the state of the YO panlist (ie, the one you received this message from).</p>
  </row>
  <row>
     <p>YO is moving its email panlisting service over
      to EliApps. While this shouldn't really make a difference to anyone's
      lives except for mine, I want to make sure this transition goes smoothly.
      You'll receive an email shortly confirming your addition to the
      new panlist: if you don't get one in a couple days, <b>let me know</b> and I'll make sure
      to get you on. Once we're moved onto the new service, anyone will be able to sign up
      to receive these glorious announcements through 
      <a href='https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/d/forum/yo.general'>this page</a>, though of course
      we will continue to happily add your friends to the list for you if they're too
      lazy.</p>
     <p>Relax and enjoy the now slowly lengthening days. We'll see you strong and refreshed in January!</p>
