  SpringYO is fast approaching; Emma covered it pretty well/I didn't take notes today in meeting. Suffice it to say that exciting things are happening, people are planning cool trips and looking for co's and cars, but there are still plenty of opportunities to do something awesome over break!</p>
  <p>
    Retreat is coming up the weekend of the 20-22nd of February. More details to be released soon...</p>
  <p>
  Initiation for new leaders is currently slated for the 27th. Watch out for an email if you'd like to be involved in the next I-board meeting. Additionally/alternatively email Angus if you want access to the planning Gdoc
