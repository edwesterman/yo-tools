        This week the Trail Running Series is headed to West Rock! If you've only ever ventured to East Rock, this is a perfect chance to get familiar with the path less-traveled. Join us for a relaxed, smooth run through some of the best spots in the park, including Judges Cave, to welcome the Spring. ~10mi roundtrip. You should feel comfortable running 7:45 min/mi pace on the road.

        Thanks to a fresh new grant we recently received courtesy of the Hazel Gadd and Alex Sharma foundation we are excited to offer a
        (space limited) free weekend trip to Elbonia in Eastern Europe this weekend! Elbonia is often described as 'indescribable,' and 
        also as 'simply indescribable.' It is the home of many species (such as the mud weasel) and geological formulations that are almost alien as they
        are not found anywhere else on Earth. This destination has been at the top of many of our leaders' lists and we couldn't be more excited
        to offer this once in a lifetime chance. All airfare and accommodation will be covered by the grant.

        Now’s your chance! Sign up for AdventureMed's Wilderness First Aid (WFA) certification course, sponsored by Yale Outdoors!

        Start your reading period off on the right foot with a hike on the Appalachian Trail/Housatonic State Forest in northwestern CT. We will leave from Yale early on Saturday, April 25 and hike approximately 12 miles over two days returning to campus late Sunday afternoon. Participants should have previous backpacking experience, but this will not be an extremely strenuous hike, and there will be time to poke around side trails and waterfalls. Preference given to those with cars.
