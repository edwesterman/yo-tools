      Dear (name),
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to thank you for putting so much time and energy into your Yale Outdoors leader application. YO is a relatively small, but very engaged organization and unfortunately, in an effort to preserve this, can only take on so many new leaders each semester. That being said, we'd love for you to become more fully involved in the broader Yale Outdoors community as a YO member, and to reapply to be a leader next semester if you're still interestedâ€“ which we certainly hope you will be. With so many extremely qualified applicants, we can't stress enough how important prior YO experience is to becoming a leader.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have a jam-packed year ahead and would absolutely love for you to be a huge part of it! In particular, if you're planning on reapplying to be a leader in the spring, we hope you'll take advantage of our <b>annual skills-focused trip series</b>: as a spring semester leader applicant, <i>you'll get priority placement on these trips as well as others</i>. Trips are going out every weekend, so stay tuned for more information coming your way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope to see you on the trail soon, and please feel free to reach out with any questions at all.
