            Congratulations!
          </p>
          <p class='subtitle'>
            You have been selected to join the ranks of Yale Outdoors as one of our new leaders!
          </p>
          <p class='subtitle'>
            We're excited to get to know you better and help you lead incredible trips around New Haven and all over the northeast. We are not just an outing club, but a community of folks who love to get outside and adventure.
          </p>

            So, what does this mean?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For now, you're what's called a <strong>Pnuckle</strong> (leader in training).
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
              You'll be a Pnuckle until you 
              <b>
                1) attend our Welcome Event on the night of February 26th
              </b>
              (more details coming soon - but it's going to be a blast) and 
              <b>
                2) co-lead your first trip with a current YO leader.
              </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you complete these two requirements, you're a full-fledged leader! Woohoo!
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class='subsubtitle'>
            What do I need to do?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Show up to YO weekly leaders meeting this coming <b>Monday, February 16th from 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm in the Davenport Dive</b> (the buttery under the dining hall). 
              </p>
              <p>            
                At these weekly dinner meetings, we share our recent outdoor adventures and coordinate upcoming trip planning. If you already have budding trip ideas for 2-3 weeks out, don't be shy to bring them with you. Otherwise, come with big ears and watch how YO makes the magic happen. These meetings are the heart and soul of the weekly rhythm of YO.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Come to <b>weekly Skills Sessions offered by current YO leaders every Monday directly following our dinner meeting, from 7:30pm to 8:00pm.</b>
              </p>
              <p>These sessions are a great way to brush up on rusty skills or acquire new ones. We kindly ask that you attend these Monday Skills Sessions for the rest semester, as a requirement for being a new leader. Skills Sessions this semester may include, but are not limited to: knot tying; stove maintenance; fire starting; tent set-up; backcountry cooking and navigation. If there's a particular skill you would like to learn or think needs refreshing (or you'd like to propose teaching yourself!), please let us know and we'll do our best to craft a Skills Session series that works well for all.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            In order to be listed as a leader on the Yale Outdoors website <b>please email a picture and a short bio to Pek (shibao.pek@yale.edu), Rafi (rafi.bildner@yale.edu) and Marcus (marcus.russi@yale.edu) by next Monday, February 16th.</b> For examples of current leader bios, check out the "Leaders" section of the website. They are funny and short.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class='subsubtitle'>
            What if I want to spend even more time with YO?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            Our semesterly <b>YO leaders-only retreat</b> is going to take place the weekend of <b>February 20th-22nd</b>. We'll send you a survey to fill out shortly if you are interested in coming! It's always a blast and features time spent with other fantastic leaders in a beautiful secluded location with an outdoor playground to enjoy.
            <p>Good food, and good company == good times.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            Stay tuned for a <b>Yale Outdoors Happy [H]Our (YOHO) in the near future.</b> These feature baked goods, beer, cheer, and stellar company! More details coming from the social couch soon!
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>SpringYO</b> (spring break trips) is an opportunity to link up with older leaders, get experience in leading a YO trip right off the bat, and knock out your co-leading requirement in an exciting way. Naturally, you'll have priority placement on SpringYO trips as a co-leading Pnuckle. Email our expedition coordinator, <b>Emma Spence (emma.spence@yale.edu)</b> ASAP if you're interested in helping lead one of our SpringYO trips. Some fantastic trips are in the works - from a southern adventure in the Shenandoah to day trips in the local area - so be in touch if you want to co-lead!
            </li>
            <li>
            We're hosting a <b>SOLO Wilderness First Aid certification course in April</b> (specific date TBD), and YO heavily subsidizes its leaders' tuition fees. Moreover, we'll host a SOLO Wilderness First Responder certification course over spring break (we will know which week it is within a few days). While becoming a WFA or WFR isn't a hard-and-fast requirement in being a leader, having one of these certifications under your belt will not only help you lead safer trips, but will also give you more flexibility in leading generally. YO policy requires at least one WFA leader on all shorter YO trips, and at least one WFR or WEMT on longer (3 days+) ones. For more details on these courses, contact <b>Emma Spence (emma.spence@yale.edu).</b>

            Some final thoughts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
               We're thrilled and grateful that you all will be joining our wonderful and crunchy-as-a-Clif Bar family. We know from your thoughtful and passionate applications that you're just as excited as we are, and we can't wait to get to know you better and start doing cool things outside together.
            </li>
            <li>
              You'll be added to the leaders' panlist shortly, and we'll look forward to seeing you at our weekly meeting next Monday (2/16)!
