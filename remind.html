Hi friends! Just a friendly reminder that applications for new Yale Outdoors leaders closes <b>tomorrow at 11:59pm</b>! We're super excited about the upcoming semester and would be psyched to have you onboard.
</p>
<p>
 Yale Outdoors isn't just an outing club (we do send a ton of cool trips out), but also a community of folks who like living life in the great outdoors. We hike, backpack, climb, ski, canoe, kayak, snowshoe, mountaineer, bike, cave - you name it, we do it. We also put on film screenings, host speakers, educate the community through Skills Sessions, and do a bunch of fun stuff together within the community of Leaders.
