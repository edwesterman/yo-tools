      On September 19, designated as International Coastal Cleanup Day by the Ocean Conservancy, people around the world will work to clean up the trash found on their local beaches and waterways. These volunteers have a big impact: last year, 560,000 volunteers in 91 countries picked up more than 16 million pounds of trash. Become part of the effort this year by participating in the coastal cleanup event at the Long Wharf Nature Preserve in New Haven at <b>10am</b>!

Join YO on the last weekend in September as we attempt one of the most legendary hikes in the White Mountains -- the Presidential Traverse. This route travels 23 miles over 9,000ft of elevation gain across a striking ridgeline connecting many of the highest peaks in the Northeastern US. We will be doing it in a single night, under a nearly full moon â€“ starting around nightfall on Saturday, and finishing early Sunday morning to enjoy an alpine sunrise. This itinerary demands exceptional fitness and the ability to quickly and safely navigate rocky, steep terrain at night.  If interested, please email sara.hamilton@yale.edu, isaac.kirk-davidoff@yale.edu, and john.golding@yale.edu and briefly describe your experience as a hiker and runner.  (Note: this trip is during Parents Weekend).
