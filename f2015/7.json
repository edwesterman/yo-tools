Do you opt for a quick packet of ramen or easy mac simply because you don't know how to whip up some yummy trail food? If so, this skills sessions is for you! Come if you have dreams of becoming a proficient backcountry chef. This clinic will last roughly an hour, and will cover the following subjects: How to stay nourished during trips of any form and length; the nutritional requirements of being highly active for several days in a row and how they can be fulfilled; balancing the many needs of eating in the outdoors (food preservation, cost, taste, ease of meal preparation, total weight, water requirements of the meal, dietary restrictions of trip participants, equipment limitations). Sample trip menus will be given, along with recipe ideas and helpful hacks to allow you to be the best trail cook possible. From baking cinnamon roles to easy pasta dinners, all will be covered. Brief discussion of ultralight, gourmet, and stoveless cooking included as well. A sample meal will be prepared. Stoves will be used to demonstrate technique but there will be no instruction on their use, maintenance, or repair.",

We will be driving down on Friday evening, camping, and then hitting the trail early Saturday morning for a full day of hiking (~8-10 miles). We will cook a delicious backcountry dinner and spend Saturday night in one of the Long Trail shelters. On Sunday, we will hike a short distance to the trailhead and aim to return to campus by mid-afternoon. The late fall weather will be fairly chilly, with temperatures likely in the 30s-40s during the day and dropping down to the 20s at night. The terrain will be moderately challenging, and some previous backpacking experience is ideal. Hopefully we will catch the last of the stunning foliage and get some spectacular views along the ridge-line! Please sign up by Sunday at midnight.",
