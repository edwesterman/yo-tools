      We want to thank you for putting so much time and energy into your Yale Outdoors leader application. YO is a relatively small, but very engaged organization and unfortunately, in an effort to preserve this, can only take on so many new leaders each semester. That being said, we'd love for you to become more fully involved in the broader Yale Outdoors community as a YO member, and to reapply to be a leader next semester if you're still interestedâ€“ which we certainly hope you will be. With so many extremely qualified applicants, we can't stress enough how important prior YO experience is to becoming a leader.

We have a jam-packed semester ahead and would absolutely love for you to be a huge part of it! In particular, we invite you to attend our fall-semester outdoor skills sessions. These are open to all YO members and focus on developing helpful wilderness skills for anyone interested in spending time outside. Look for announcement about the skills sessions in the weekly newsletter.
