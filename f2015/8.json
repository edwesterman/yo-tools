Do you opt for a quick packet of ramen or easy mac simply because you don't know how to whip up some yummy trail food? If so, this skills sessions is for you! Come if you have dreams of becoming a proficient backcountry chef. This clinic will last roughly an hour, and will cover the following subjects: How to stay nourished during trips of any form and length; the nutritional requirements of being highly active for several days in a row and how they can be fulfilled; balancing the many needs of eating in the outdoors (food preservation, cost, taste, ease of meal preparation, total weight, water requirements of the meal, dietary restrictions of trip participants, equipment limitations). Sample trip menus will be given, along with recipe ideas and helpful hacks to allow you to be the best trail cook possible. From baking cinnamon roles to easy pasta dinners, all will be covered. Brief discussion of ultralight, gourmet, and stoveless cooking included as well. A sample meal will be prepared. Stoves will be used to demonstrate technique but there will be no instruction on their use, maintenance, or repair.",

This race isn't your average bike ride: It's a completely solo, unsupported 4,233 mile journey across the United States. This film, produced/directed by the filmmakers who created the award winning documentary, Ride the Divide (about the Great Divide mountain bike race from Canada to Mexico), chronicles endurance athletes who you've never heard of, in an event you've never heard of, pushing themselves to the absolute limit. They ride through the night, in all weather conditions, cycling as fast as they possibly can from coast to coast, with everything they need on their bikes. The film was just released, and it's sure to be a blast to watch, and very inspiring! The screening will be on <b>Saturday, at 5:00 pm in Linsly-Chittenden (LC) Hall Room 317 (63 High Street).</b> Snacks and drinks provided!",

In all his travels he never engaged in conversation with anyone beyond monosyllabic phrases like \"Eat\" or \"Yes,\" nor did he ever stay inside, always choosing to spend the nights and winters in the great outdoors. One of his stops on his route was the Old Leatherman Cave, right here in Watertown, CT, where we will be hiking this weekend.</p><p>In addition to there being a really cool cave where we'll hike to, there's also a beautiful lookout at the top (a place to have a picnic) where we can take in the last of the fall foliage and rolling Connecticut hills. The trail itself is a moderate 4 mile (total) out and back along the Mattatuck trail, and no experience is fine! There is a little bit of rock scrambling involved.</p><p>It will probably take us about 2 hours, maybe a bit longer to be safe, just allowing for time to hang out at the top and taking the pace easy, and is about 45 minutes away.</p>",
