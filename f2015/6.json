The film weaves the story of three characters' experiences with immense mountain beauty and small-town culture as they attempt to pedal from Banff, Canada to a small, dusty crossing on the Mexican border. The YO House is located at 229 Dwight Street, and if you sign up you'll get a more detailed email about how to get there.",

Come join YO in participating in a special all-day Boundary Maintenance Workshop, in which we will learn about everything from how the corridor is managed, to how to read and interpret land deeds. After the boundary workshop, we'll go to a giant BBQ. Signups close on <b>Wednesday at 6pm</b>!",

We'll be leaving campus Tuesday afternoon as early as possible given folk's class schedules and returning to New Haven by Friday afternoon. Our trip will start near Becket and we'll go south to Great Barrington. In between we'll hike through the heart and soul of the Berks, including the Upper and Lower Goose Ponds of Lee and Beartown State Forest in Monterey. We'll plan to hike roughly 20 miles in two days and end early Friday in the vibrant town of Great Barrington with a delicious meal at Martin's Restaurant, one of the best breakfasts in the Berkshires. Maybe we'll even snag some apple cider donuts at Windy Hill Orchard if there's time. Plan for beautiful fall foliage but prepare for almost winter camping conditions with temperatures potentially dropping into the low 30's. Given the need to drop cars since this isn't a loop, spaces are limited and preference will be given to those with cars. Previous backpacking experience is a plus, given the amount of miles we are covering!",

We'll leave campus at 6am sharp in order to catch the sunrise.  The run will be somewhere between 9-13mi and will be most appropriate if you typically run 7:00-8:30min/mi pace on the road.  We'll conclude with an egg breakfast of unfathomable proportions served on the shore of the Saugatuck Reservoir (vegan options available).  Don't miss this take on what every New England runner's autumn morning should look like!  Back by 11am, with our cars' emissions ameliorated by purchasing a small carbon offset."
