This past year Yale Outdoors successfully added over twenty new leaders to our ranks, and that means more trips than ever are going out. However, we're now looking to bring on several new Leaders to further the mission of Yale Outdoors and keep the organization strong. We are thrilled to release our leader application for this semester, and can't wait to have you join us!
</p>
<p>
Yale Outdoors is not just an outing club (we do send pretty awesome trips out, though), but a community of folks passionate about getting outside, and living life in the great outdoors. We hike, backpack, climb, ski, canoe, kayak, snowshoe, mountaineer, bike, cave - you name it, we do it. We also put on film screenings, host speakers, educate the community through Skills Sessions, and do a bunch of fun stuff together within the community of Leaders.
</p>
<p>
Becoming a leader is a simple process. Prior outdoors experience is a plus, but it's not a necessity. There are a few basic requirements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Attend our weekly Monday dinner meetings, where we hang out and plan trips
    </li>
    <li>
    Come to three of the six Skill Sessions (cooking, navigation, repair, outdoor leadership, shelter, and the Special Session) over the course of the Fall semester.
    </li>
    <li>
    Be willing to take either a Wilderness First Aid or Wilderness First Responder course â€“ we host and subsidize these each semester.
    </li>
    <li>
    Thursday, October 8th: Attend the Pnuckle Orientation on campus
    </li>
    <li>
    Saturday, October 17th: Attend the Pnuckle Retreat in upstate CT (transportation provided)
    </li>
    <li>
    Last but not least, organize at least one YO trip per semester!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>

Upon successful completion of your first trip, you'll become a full-fledged Yale Outdoors Leader!
