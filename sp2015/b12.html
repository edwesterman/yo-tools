Want to start out your day refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready to take on the world? Join Yale Outdoors as we bike to West Rock this Friday to watch the beautiful sunrise. This trip will require a bike, so bring your own, borrow a friends, or see about Zagster (sometimes a little sketchy). If you are in need of a bike, let us know and we'll see what we can do, but no guarantees. You absolutely MUST have a helmet to come on this trip. Please bring a front and rear light. Even flashlights will do. Water, snacks, camera, warm clothes also recommended. We'll leave at 05:00am and be back by 07:30am.

This Friday, join YO as we watch an outdoor movie under the stars, at the Yale Farm pavilion at 8:00! We'll be projecting the movie onto a large screen, and it will of course be an outdoor-inspired film, perhaps 180 Degrees South, Ride the Divide, or K2: Siren of the Himalayas, but rest assured that it will be one of our crunchy favorites, and that One-Match Mossman himself will be manning the projector. We'll have some food for everyone, and some blankets in case it gets cold. It will be an awesome night of outdoor goodness, at one of the most special places on campus. We can't wait!

      Join the YO Service and Outreach Committee and sign up to participate in the New Haven Farms volunteer work day on April 18th! New Haven Farms is a non-profit organization that promotes health and community development through urban agriculture. The organization needs help building its newest farm on the 18th. The site is just a short bike ride away; we will leave campus at 9:40 am, work from 10-12, and be back on campus by 12:30. When you sign up, please sign up through YO and also fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/forms/d/1ScMmKW5DOTnIsBkSeLBj1CuMoNNolYHSTeOEnkqsXaw/viewform">this online form</a> so that New Haven Farms knows how many volunteers to expect.

Enjoy spring while wandering the dramatic Hanging Hills and faux-ancient Castle Craig, just half an hour from campus. We'll leave campus at 1:00, eat snacks on top of the tower, skirt the traprock cliffs and be back by around 8:00 pm. Preference given to those who have cars.

        Start your reading period off on the right foot with a hike on the Appalachian Trail/Housatonic State Forest in northwestern CT. We will leave from Yale early on Saturday, April 25 and hike approximately 12 miles over two days returning to campus late Sunday afternoon. Participants should have previous backpacking experience, but this will not be an extremely strenuous hike, and there will be time to poke around side trails and waterfalls. Preference given to those with cars.
