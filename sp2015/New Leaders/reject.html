    Dear name,
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to thank you for putting so much time and energy into your Yale Outdoors leader application. YO is a relatively small, but very engaged organization and unfortunately, in an effort to preserve this, can only take on so many new leaders each semester. That being said, we'd love for you to become more fully involved in the broader Yale Outdoors community as a YO member, and to reapply to be a leader next semester if you're still interested– which we certainly hope you will be. With so many extremely qualified applicants, we can't stress enough how important prior YO experience is to becoming a leader.

We have a jam-packed semester ahead and would absolutely love for you to be a part of it! In particular, we invite you to attend our outdoor skills sessions​​
. These will take place several times each semester, and are open to all YO members! We will focus on developing helpful wilderness skills like shelter building, stove repair, cooking, and outdoor leadership for anyone interested in spending time outside. Look for announcements about these skills sessions in our weekly newsletter.

      Hope to see you on the trail soon, and please feel free to reach out with any questions at all.
