      Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.

        What better way to start your Friday than all bundled up, sipping a thermos of hot coco, watching a molten-lava snail rise up out of KBT? Whether you're a regular or a newcomer, we'll be heading back to West Rock park, a mere 15 minute drive from campus on Friday morning. The plan is to leave from Phelps Gate at 05:50, and return by 8 or so. Preference given to those with cars. IT WILL BE COLD... but light cloud cover will make this trip totally worth it.

        If the only runs you’ve done in East Rock went up to the summit and straight back down, you’re missing out on the miles of fantastic trail running the park has to offer. Join us for a traverse of its four major peaks (Whitney Peak, East Rock, Indian Head, Snake Rock), and discover the wealth of scenic running that lies just two miles from campus. ~8mi with an optional 4mi add-on. You should feel comfortable running 7:45 min/mi pace on the road.

        The Tuscarora Trail is a 240 mile side trail to the AT, by-passing the normally crowded areas of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West-by-God Virginia. It has some strenuous terrain and a bit of road-walking, but it offers great, little-seen views of the Shenandoah area on rarely-tread trails. The multi-day backpacking trip will cover a portion of the Virginia section of the trail, covering around 50 miles at a moderate pace (10-15 mile days). Looking for 6-8 hikers with previous multi-day backpacking experience, cars a plus.

        Come hiking at beautiful Wadsworth Falls on Friday March 20th. We'll leave campus at 10am and be back by 3pm. We'll hike on a 3.5 mile (round trip) path along a river to a 20ft waterfall where we'll enjoy a wonderful picnic! We'll have time to explore some side trails, too. No hiking experience necessary!
