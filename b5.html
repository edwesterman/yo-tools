        Florian Hill is a German-Austrian mountaineer who has led many expeditions into Alaska, the South-American Andes, Himalaya, Central Asia and Myanmar. He also completed important first ascents, for example the route “deliver me” at the infamous south-face of the Illimani in Bolivia (6439 m). His adventures have been documented in several National Geographic feature articles.
