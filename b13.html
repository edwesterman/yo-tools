Enjoy a beautiful bike ride on the morning of Spring Fling as YO does New Havenâ€™s

annual Rock to Rock Earth Day bike ride. We will be biking the 20-mile route which 

starts in West Rock, takes a brief rest stop at Sleeping Giant, and finishes at East 

Rock. We will leave Yale at 8:30 am and be back around 1 pm. The registration cost 

is $35 dollars, but this all goes to supporting environmental organizations in New 

Haven. Helmets and bikes are required. For more info see the <a href="http://rocktorock.donordrive.com">Rock to Rock 

  website</a>.

        Start your reading period off on the right foot with a hike on the Appalachian Trail/Housatonic State Forest in northwestern CT. We will leave from Yale early on Saturday, April 25 and hike approximately 12 miles over two days returning to campus late Sunday afternoon. Participants should have previous backpacking experience, but this will not be an extremely strenuous hike, and there will be time to poke around side trails and waterfalls. Preference given to those with cars.

Want to take a break from studying for those tests and writing those papers? Join YO

as we take a fun and relaxing hammock hike to the Salmon River Trail. We will leave 

Yale around 11 am on Tuesday the 28th, and return around 6 pm. The trip will 

consist of some light hiking followed by chilling in hammocks. What to bring: Water, 

snacks, a book or journal, your hammock! Please let us know if you have a hammock 

or if you will need to borrow one and if you have a car.

        Come join us for an evening of frog listening over reading week. Since 
        it's very weather dependent, we can't know exactly when will be the best
        day, but sign up if you want to stay in the loop. We'll send you an email
        specifying the date as reading week gets closer.
