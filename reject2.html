      Hey Elizabeth,
    </p>
    <p>
      We're really sorry to have to tell you that we won't be offering you a spot as a new leader this term. We seriously had to discuss your app the most out of everyone else's and in the end the applicant pool was just too strong. Past participation in YO events as well as past trip planning and leading experience became two quite important factors in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recognize your natural leadership capabilities and your desire to get off campus; we have an exciting semester ahead of us and hope that you will find a way to get more involved with YO throughout it. We'd love to have you re-apply next term!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope to see you on the trail soon, and please feel free to reach out with any questions at all.
