      Dear Emma,
    </p>
    <p>
     Thank you for re-applying to be  YO leader this semester. YO is a relatively small, but very engaged organization and unfortunately, in an effort to preserve this, can only take on so many new leaders each semester. That being said, we really would love for you to become more fully involved in the broader Yale Outdoors community as a YO member and, afterwards, re-apply.  We sympathize with your desire to be in the outdoors more, and in an effort to help you achieve this, would love to offer you priority on any YO trips you choose to go on. While we understand that it is oftentimes difficult to find friends to go on trips, we also assure you that our leader corps is extremely friendly and committed to making sure all participants feel comfortable on all YO trips and in the outdoors in general. With such a strong new-leader applicant pool, we can't stress enough how important prior YO experience is to becoming a leader.    </p>
    <p>We have an exciting semester ahead and hope you will find a way to be a part of it! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope to see you on the trail soon, and please feel free to reach out with any questions at all.
