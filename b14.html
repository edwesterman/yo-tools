May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds.

  Good luck with your papers, projects, and exams, and don't forget to get outside, if just for a bit!

Alright, the details are in. We'll head out Wednesday evening at 7:45pm and drive to sleeping giant state park where we'll go for a short hike and listen to some frogs. It's going to be chilly, so we can't promise a great frog turnout, but hopefully there will be a few. We hope to be back around 10pm. Please sign up by Wednesday at noon. Preference given to those with cars.

Have you ever noticed all the litter along the mill river at the base of East Rock? Does it bother you? Join us as we head to East Rock this Thursday from 10am-2pm to pick up trash on the path  alongside the river. We'll provide trash bags and gloves, and maybe some snacks. Feel free to come for all, or just part of the time. With a good number of people it shouldn't take long to clean it all up and make it beautiful again. Many of us enjoy the sanctuary that park offers, whether for running or relaxing, and spending a few hours cleaning it up will show our appreciation of it. Please sign up by Wednesday at 9pm and feel free to bring friends.
