        Ever wanted to know how to splint a broken bone with a crazy creek? Roll your buddy up into a human burrito with a tarp to protect him/her from hypothermia? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now’s your chance! Sign up for AdventureMed's Wilderness First Aid (WFA) certification course, sponsored by Yale Outdoors! WFA certification will teach you fundamental first aid skills, so when you venture into the great outdoors you’ll know how to effectively respond to basic injuries and illnesses.

A limited number of partial scholarships are available for those who can demonstrate financial need.  A team of Yale doctors will be teaching the course, combining their own real-world experience with the fantastic AdventureMed curriculum.
