            We're excited to get to know you better and help you lead incredible trips around New Haven and all over the northeast. We are not just an outing club, but a community of folks who love to get outside and adventure.

            So, what does this mean?

          <ul>
            <li>
              For now, you're what's called a <strong>Pnuckle</strong> (leader in training).
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
              You'll be a Pnuckle until you

              </li>
              (more details coming soon - but it's going to be a blast),

                At these weekly dinner meetings, we share our recent outdoor adventures and coordinate upcoming trip planning. If you already have budding trip ideas for 2-3 weeks out, don't be shy to bring them with you. Otherwise, come with big ears and watch how YO makes the magic happen. These meetings are the heart and soul of the weekly rhythm of YO.

                Come to <b>weekly Skills Sessions offered by current YO leaders.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
              These sessions are a great way to brush up on rusty skills or acquire new ones. You must to attend three of them to become a full-fledged member. The first skill session is on Shelters and will take place before this Monday's meeting at 5 o'clock in the Davenport Buttery (check the YO weekly update). Other skill sessions include Cooking, Outdoor Leadership, Wilderness First Aid, Stoves, and navigation. More details will be announced in time.

            <b>FallYO</b> (fall break trips) is an opportunity to link up with older leaders, get experience in leading a YO trip right off the bat, and knock out your co-leading requirement in an exciting way. Naturally, you'll have priority placement on FallYO trips as a co-leading Pnuckle. Email our expedition coordinator, <b>David Milewicz (david.milewicze@yale.edu)</b> ASAP if you're interested in helping lead one of our FallYO trips. Some fantastic trips are in the works - from a southern adventure in the Shenandoah to day trips in the local area - so be in touch if you want to co-lead!
